# Task Management API

The Task Management API is a RESTful API that provides functionality for managing tasks. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks, with authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure access.

## Features

### User Authentication

The API provides user registration and authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Users can sign up, log in, and receive a token for subsequent API requests. The token should be included in the Authorization header for authenticated requests.

### Task CRUD Operations

The API supports the following CRUD operations for tasks:

- Create: Users can create new tasks by sending a POST request to the appropriate endpoint with the task details.
- Read: Users can retrieve a list of tasks by sending a GET request to the endpoint.
- Update: Users can update existing tasks by sending a PUT or PATCH request to the endpoint with the task ID and updated details.
- Delete: Users can delete tasks by sending a DELETE request to the endpoint with the task ID.

### Task Filtering and Sorting

The API provides endpoints to filter and sort tasks based on various criteria such as task status, priority, due date, or assignee. Users can specify these parameters in the query string to retrieve specific subsets of tasks.

### User Roles and Permissions

The API includes role-based authorization, allowing different users to have different levels of access and permissions to tasks. For example, only the task creator or assigned user can update or delete a task. Roles can be assigned during user registration or updated through the user profile endpoints.

### User Profile

Users can view and update their profiles through dedicated API endpoints. They can change passwords, update personal information, and manage other profile-related functionalities.

### Error Handling and Validation

The API performs thorough error handling and validation of request data to provide meaningful error messages and maintain data integrity. It returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error responses when encountering invalid requests or errors.

### Pagination and Limiting

To handle large sets of data, the API supports pagination by limiting the number of tasks returned per request. Users can specify the page number and the number of tasks per page to navigate through the data effectively.

### API Documentation

Comprehensive API documentation is generated using Swagger or Postman. It describes all the available endpoints, their request/response formats, and the authentication requirements. The documentation assists developers in understanding and integrating with the API easily.

### Testing and Deployment

The API is thoroughly tested using unit tests to ensure the correctness of critical functionalities. It can be deployed to a cloud platform like Heroku or AWS for demonstration purposes.

### Logging and Monitoring

The API implements logging and monitoring mechanisms to track API usage, detect errors, and monitor performance metrics. These mechanisms help in troubleshooting issues, optimizing performance, and ensuring the API's reliability.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js and Express.js for the API implementation
- MongoDB or any other database for storing task and user data
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication
- Swagger or Postman for API documentation
- Unit testing frameworks such as Jest or Mocha for testing
- Cloud platforms like Heroku or AWS for deployment
- Logging and monitoring tools like Winston or Prometheus for logging and performance monitoring
